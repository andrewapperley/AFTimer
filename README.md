AFTimer
=======

A simple app for a simple missing feature. This allows you to set a timer for up to an hour and have it vibrate the watch when it is done. I personally use it for when I'm brewing coffee.

####Controls are:####
* Up/Down(long or short): Change value
* Select(short): Change from minutes and seconds
* Select(long): Start timer
* Select(short while timer is active): Cancels timer
